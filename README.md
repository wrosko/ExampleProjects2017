# Example ANN and Stochastic Optimization Projects
Examples of some machine ANNs built from scratch

ANN projects including Hopfield models, backpropagation, competitive learning, 
kohonen network, and oja's rule. 

Stochastic optimization projects contain code for ant colony optimization, linear genetic programming, genetic 
algorithms, particle swarm optimization.
